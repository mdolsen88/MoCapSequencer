# Introduction
MoCapSequencer has been developed as a tool in the Ph.D. project entitled **"Organization of the neural drive to spinal motor neurons in visually guided gait modifications in children and adults with and without cerebral palsy"**, by Helle Marie HÃ¼che Larsen.

The software handles visual presentation, synchronization and recording of various systems.

The application was inspired by the work by Choi, Julia T. et al [[1]](#1).

# Supported systems/features
The current list of supported systems are:

 * Motion Capture
   * Qualisys (Qualisys AB, Sweeden)
   * Optitrack (NaturalPoint Inc, USA)
 * Retisense INSIGHT Pressure insoles (https://www.retisense.com/product/stridalyzer-insight-sensor-insoles/)
 * Tobii Pro Glasses 3 (Tobii AB, Sweeden)
 * Synchronization of third part systems through a USB-BNC adapter (output only)
